# DevNexus 2017 Advanced TypeScript Breakout
This repository contains the source code for the Advanced Typescript breakout session at DevNexus 2017.

The repository is organized into steps for transitioning a Node.js application from vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript with Mocha unit tests.  Finally, dependency injection is added to the project to facilitate alternating repositories.  

Each folder contains the previous step's completed code.  In other words, the code in each folder is what your code should look like once the necessary changes from the _previous step_ have been made.  For example, the `Step 2` folder contains all of the code changes outlined in `Step 1` (`Step 2` is a _completed version_ of `Step 1's` instructions).

## Objectives
The objective(s) of each folder are outlined below.

### Starter
The starter folder contains a basic Node.js express server that serves a simple Angular 2 application. The Angular 2 application queries data from an API exposed by the Node.js application.  The data returned by the API is hard-coded. 
### 1. Add unit tests to api, data

### 2. Add unit tests to server.js
### 3. Convert server.js typescript, update unit tests
### 4. Convert api, data to typescript
### 5. Create second repository (XML), add unit tests
### 6. Add InversifyJS, wire up IoC
### 7. Bonus: add named dependencies
